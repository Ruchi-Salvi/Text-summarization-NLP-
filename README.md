# NLP Text Summarization Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **Text Summarization**, a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal of this project is to develop an extractive summarization model that identifies and extracts the most significant information from a given text to create a concise and coherent summary. The system has been tested on **Wikipedia articles**.

## Objectives

- Develop an **extractive text summarization** model.
- Pre-process the input text by tokenizing sentences and performing stemming operations.
- Score sentences based on text features such as citations and synonyms.
- Use machine learning techniques, including **neural networks**, to classify sentences as part of the summary or not.
- Allow user control over the **length of the summary** as a percentage of the original text.

## Features

- **Pre-processing:** Input text is tokenized and processed to remove stop words and perform stemming.
- **Sentence Scoring:** Sentences are scored based on various features like citations, synonym recognition, and traditional methods.
- **Summary Customization:** Users can specify the length of the summary by defining what percentage of the original text should be summarized.
- **Performance:** The system gives the best results when sentences are scored based on citations.

## Key Methodologies

1. **Extractive Approach:** Identifying and extracting keyphrases from the source document using **part-of-speech tagging** and word frequency analysis.
2. **Neural Networks:** Used for classifying sentences based on their computed score to determine their inclusion in the summary.
3. **Preprocessing Techniques:** Tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal to prepare the text for summarization.

## Evaluation

The model was evaluated on multiple Wikipedia articles, and it was found that scoring based on **citations** provided the most accurate summaries. Other features such as sentence length and frequency of key phrases also contributed to the scoring process.

## Conclusion

Text summarization is an effective method to reduce the length of documents while retaining essential information. This project demonstrates an **extractive summarization model** that performs well with citation-based sentence scoring. Further research could focus on **abstractive summarization** and real-time summarization techniques to improve the quality and scope of summaries.
